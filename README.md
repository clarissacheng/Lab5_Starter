## Check your understanding answers:-
1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
* I would not use a unit test to test the message feature of a messaging application. In order to know if that feature is working correctly or not, I need to know how messaging interact with server, sender, and the receiever. Since, it needs to interact
  with multiple parts of an application, it won't be feasible to use unit test.
2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
* I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This small feature can easily be debugged and tested using example messages that either may be longer than the limit so unit testing would be feasible.
